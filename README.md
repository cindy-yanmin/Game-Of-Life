# Game-Of-Life

Implementing Conway's well known Game of Life is a good way of starting to learn a new programming language. You can find more than you need to know at, e.g., the Wikipedia entry. But only the rules are necessary for the implementation purpose:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

Here are the example [input file](./input.txt) and corresponding [output file](./output.txt).
